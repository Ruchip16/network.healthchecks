    This role performs a crash files health check on network devices.
    For Cisco IOS XR devices it runs "show logging | include crash";
    for Cisco IOS devices it runs "show crashinfo:"; for NXâ€‘OS it runs "show cores";
    and for Arista EOS it runs "show tech-support | include crash".
    The role then parses the output and asserts that no crash records are found.
